About me

Hailing from Anchorage Alaska, I'm a proud Inuit Native. Having over 20 years of working on personal computers and networks, I decided to make it a career path after hearing glowing reviews from valued clients. With a general CompTIA A+ Cert I supported companies such as Dell, Boeing, Lockheed, NASA, Apex, ASRC Federal and most recently Ron Jon Surf Shop. I've also worked in manufacturing, having built the Hummingbird Helicopter with Vertical Aviations. I also worked in retail/food service, where I was normally promoted into lead positions and worked with teams to set company records that still stand to this day. 


I bring this diverse background and skillset of 20 + years of customer service and working with computers.
